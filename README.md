# Machine-Learning-Stock-Models

# Overview

Dr. Mondesire Post: In this project, your team will create 6 stock price classification models in one script. The models will identify if a stock will increase by 5%, decrease by 2%, or neither in 30 minutes.

You will build function-based code that analyzes historical stock data (at least 2 months, with 1-minute interval price data) and determine the accuracy, recall, and precision of each model's 1-month, 1-minute price testing data. You will also analyze if the models are overfit and justify with appropriate statistics. Lastly, you will answer if the accuracies are significantly different from one another to determine which model is the best.

# Approach

Depending on wthe model we used we had to approach each algorithm in a manner that suited in order to get a working model. Another observation to note is that stock price ocillations do not necessarily fluctuate by many pertage points, so in order to create classifications we measured whether a stock increased in price or decreased in price, or remained at the same level.

# Effectiveness

Depending on the Type of model, the effectiveness of the model was mediocre to Good. We tend to see with the black box models, we have very low metrics. When not using black box model, we tend to have better accuracy.

# Instructions

To runn the code - open the R file and all libraries should be able to be installed and run within the file itself.
